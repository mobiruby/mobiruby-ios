## Welcome to MobiRuby for iOS (alpha)

Notice: It's for mruby and iOS hackers


## Getting started

At first time, you might need to install the below gems:

```
sudo /usr/bin/gem install xcodeproj
sudo /usr/bin/gem install nokogiri
```

And then, type the commands in terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/mobiruby/mobiruby-ios.git
cd mobiruby-ios
sh setup.sh
open mobiruby-ios.xcodeproj
```

If you use XCode beta version, you should modify ``bin/build-config.sh`` or set up xcode-select correctly.


It's tested only Mountain Lion and XCode 4.4.1.
